# STACK Management

**stackctl** is a lightweight Bash tool to manage multiple Docker Compose stacks at once. It is designed for homelab users who maintain dozens of containerized services grouped under a single parent directory, offering a simple interactive menu to deploy, update, and stop stacks efficiently.

---

## âœ¨ Features

* **Deploy Stack** â€“ Start one or many stacks
* **Update Stack** â€“ Pull new images and restart containers
* **Stop Stack** â€“ Stop one or many stacks
* **Status View** â€“ Lists stacks with quick indicators (green dot = running, red dot = stopped)

---

## ðŸš€ Run The Script

Run once without installing:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAW-Network/stackctl/main/stackctl.sh | bash
```
---

## ðŸ“‚ Directory layout requirements

**Very important:** `stackctl` assumes your stacks live as subfolders under a single **parent directory**. Each stack folder must contain one of:

* `docker-compose.yml`
* `docker-compose.yaml`
* `compose.yml`
* `compose.yaml`

Example layout:

```
/DATA/AppData/
â”œâ”€ portainer/
â”‚  â””â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€ smokeping/
â”‚  â””â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€ beszel/
â”‚  â””â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€ ...
```
### Important:

* The script uses the directory **where the script file is located** as the parent root.
* If your parent directory is `/DATA/AppData`, you should place `stackctl.sh` inside `/DATA/AppData`. This ensures all subfolders are detected as stacks.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation


Install systemâ€‘wide so you can run it from anywhere:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAW-Network/stackctl/main/stackctl.sh -o ./stackctl.sh
chmod +x ./stackctl.sh
ln -s $(pwd)/stackctl.sh /usr/local/bin/stackctl
```

Run the command:

```bash
stackctl
```

Interactive menu:

```
Directory: /DATA/AppData
1) DEPLOY STACK
2) UPDATE STACK
3) STOP STACK
4) EXIT
```

Selection input supports:

* `0` = all stacks
* Commaâ€‘separated indices: `1,5,12`
* Keywords: `portainer,smokeping`

Youâ€™ll see a progress bar per action and a summary at the end.

To Uninstall Just Run:
```bash
rm /usr/local/bin/stackctl
```

## âœ… Quick checklist

* Parent directory contains one compose file per stack folder
* Run from the correct parent directory (or use the alias technique above)
* Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed and accessible
